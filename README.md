# Data Analysis Case Studies

This repository contains a collection of data analysis case studies, documenting my experience as a Project Manager and an Associate Developer at a startup in India. Throughout my roles, I encountered diverse project development deliverables, requiring a mix of hard skills such as data management, data analysis, and software development, as well as soft skills like negotiation and understanding client requirements from a developer's perspective.
